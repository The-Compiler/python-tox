# python-tox extension for Visual Studio Code

This extension integrates the [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/) task automation tool with Visual Studio Code.

<!-- TODO: screenshot -->

## Here be dragons

**Note:** The extension was mainly written to scratch my own itch, and this is
the first time I'm writing something "real" using TypeScript and NodeJS.

Contributions, suggestions and improvements of all kinds are very welcome,
but use at your own risk.

## Extension Commands

* `python-tox.select`: Show a menu allowing to pick a tox environment.
* `python-tox.selectMultiple`: Show a menu allowing to pick multiple tox environments.

## Release Notes

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
